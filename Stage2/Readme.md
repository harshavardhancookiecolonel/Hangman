Description:

In this stage, we will add some simple gameplay. There will be two possible outcomes. Let's first print a welcoming message and then ask players to guess the word we have set for the game. If they guess the word, the game reports a win; otherwise, it will "hang" the player.

Objectives:

Ask players for a possible word;
Print You survived! if users guess the word;
Print You lost! if users fail.

Example 1:

H A N G M A N

Guess the word: > python

You survived!

H A N G M A N

Guess the word: > java

You lost!
