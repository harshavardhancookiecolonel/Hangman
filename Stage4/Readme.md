DESCRIPTION:

The game is now more difficult to beat; your chances of guessing the word depend on the list size. If there are four words in the list, you have a 25% chance. Let's show a little mercy and add hints for our players.

OBJECTIVES:

As in the previous stage, use the following word list: python, java, swift, javascript.

Once the computer has chosen a word from the list, show its first three letters. Replace the hidden letters with hyphens (-).

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:

H A N G M A N

Guess the word jav-: > java

You survived!

Example 2:

H A N G M A N

Guess the word pyt---: > pythia

You lost!
